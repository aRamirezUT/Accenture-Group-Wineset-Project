# Accenture-Group-Wineset-Project
Note this is a very old project from July of 2021 during my internship with Accenture Federal Services. I could not share the original notebook because the intern who created did not make it public so I had to download and create a separate notebook to publish publicly.
Here is a brief description of the notebook... 
Collaboration with a team of three interns to create a comprehensive project, focused on analyzing a large wine dataset. Successfully developed charts and maps to showcase data trends such as reviewer popularity, top countries, and highest scores. Employed agile methodologies, including Scrum meetings and consistent communication with the team lead.
